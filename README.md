Reference Architecture

# Setup

- run start.ps1 (windows) / start.sh (linux), this builds the docker images and starts them up - this is not intended for development though
- Optionally, if you want dependencies installed locally for development, run npm install in each application directory (my-nodejs-api, my-react-app)
